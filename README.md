# Pet Pal: A Java-based Desktop Application for Tracking Pet Care
## Project Proposal 
<!--Added Title and Sub-title-->

- This application allows pet owners to keep track of important 
activities related to their pet's care and well-being. The application
will let users record when they fed, gave water, gave treats, 
and took their pet for a walk. Additionally, the application will 
offer personalized recommendations for pet owners, based on 
the previous recorded activities. This will help determine 
the pet's current needs and provide helpful suggestions on 
how to address any signs of irritation or distress.
This innovative feature will make it easier for pet 
owners to care for their pets, ensuring their well-being 
and comfort, even in uncertain situations.
The application will also provide a user-friendly interface for viewing the recorded activities, 
searching and filtering through them, and setting reminders for 
regularly scheduled tasks. The application will be designed to be 
easy to use and understandable, so that pet owners can quickly and 
efficiently manage their pet's care.


- The target users of this application are pet owners who want an 
efficient and convenient way to keep track of their pet's daily 
routine. The app will be particularly useful for people who have 
busy schedules and need to keep track of their pet's activities 
to ensure they are providing proper care. 


- This project is of interest to me because I am a pet owner myself, and I understand 
the importance of tracking my pet's care to ensure their well-being. Furthermore, this app would make it
easier for newly turned pet-owners to cater to the requirements of their pets, easily and without any confusions by keeping in track
when and how they last interacted with their pets. I believe that this project will provide me with an opportunity 
to combine my interest in pet care with my passion for programming
and software development.
